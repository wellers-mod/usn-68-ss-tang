# '68 Tang-class SSK

As part of the development of the Tang-class submarine for Cold Waters 1962, I created a '68 variant. This version is longer than the '62 variant and utilises the Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System (PUFFS) sonar.

Requires at least DotMod v0.4a-2.

## Installation
1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) Download the latest version of the mod from [Releases](https://github.com/wellers/usn-68-ss-tang/releases)
3) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, unzipped the contents of the downloaded zip into the "MODS" folder - this usually resides under your Cold Waters installation directory.
4) Open JSGME. The addon should appear under "Available Mods". 
5) Activate the mod.
   
_Note:_ if you don't want to install the mod using JSGME, you can just copy the mod's "ColdWaters_Data" folder into your Cold Waters installation directory - the content matches the folder structure.

## Notes
* To ensure there is minimal impact to your installation of Cold Waters, I'd advise you to apply the mod to a fresh install of Cold Waters with DotMod v0.4a-2.
