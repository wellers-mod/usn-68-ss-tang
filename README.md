# '68 Tang-class SSK

As part of the development of the Tang-class submarine for Cold Waters 1962, I created a '68 variant. This version is longer than the '62 variant and utilises the Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System (PUFFS) sonar.

Requires at least DotMod v0.4a-2.

## Installation
1) Ensure you are starting with a fresh install of Cold Waters and DotMod v0.4a-2.
2) If you use JSGME with Cold Waters, add the mod to your MODS folder and activate through JSGME.exe.
   
_Note:_ if you don't use JSGME, you can just copy the mod's content into your Cold Waters installation directory as the content matches the folder structure.

## Notes
* To ensure there is minimal impact to your installation of Cold Waters, I'd advise you to apply the mod to a fresh install of Cold Waters with DotMod v0.4a-2.
